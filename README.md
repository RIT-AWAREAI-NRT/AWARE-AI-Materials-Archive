This repository belongs to the AWARE-AI (NRT) community at RIT. This repository contains links to workshops, seed-funding proposals, evaluation and roundtables details related to AWARE-AI program at RIT.

Sensing-based AI systems are making predictions and responding to humans in numerous applications. However, enormous research challenges are emerging. AI systems must react responsibly and flexibly, respect diversity and privacy, and achieve trustworthiness to avoid unintended consequences. The AWARE-AI NRT project will provide unique training to a diverse student body. The project anticipates training 75 master's and Ph.D. students, including 25 funded trainees, from various fields. Through innovative educational features like lab rotations, internships, and diversity workshops, trainees will advance scientific knowledge in human-sensing AI across four research tracks linked to use-inspired areas. The AWARE-AI NRT project is designed to encourage the development of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.
